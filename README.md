Why is API documentation important in real projects?
When working on real-life projects,
having API documentation becomes valuable 
because it describes how to communicate with said API,
how to connect with it, what type of information to provide, 
and what information will be sent back to them. 
Clear documentation enables developers to interact with the API without having to make educated guesses,
thus saving time  and fostering collaborative team efforts.
